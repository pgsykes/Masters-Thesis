\section{Background Information} \label{sec_background}



\subsection{Optical Impairments}

There are many linear and non-linear impairments of an optical signal.  Linear impairments are attenuation and dispersion.  The non-linear impairments are scattering (Rayleigh, Brillouin, Raman), self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing, and cross-phase modulation. Each of these impairments will affect the accuracy of a timing signal. Under a suitable power threshold some of the non-linear impairments will negligibly affect the timing signal.

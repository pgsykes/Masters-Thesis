\chapter{Introduction}

There are applications that require sharing a time signal between devices.  One example is Global Positioning System (GPS) where a time signal is required to calculate geolocation.  Currently, there are techniques and systems for time and frequency transfer in wireless communication systems.  A notable example is the two-way satellite time and frequency transfer system which enables two laboratories to use a satellite as a common link to synchronize clocks.  The two laboratories will send and receive a time signal.  The received time signal is compared to their local clock and the difference between the two is the round trip delay.  Then, it is assumed that the delay is equal between both locations, so half of the round trip delay becomes the delay correction.  In another approach, each of two systems receives a time signal from the other system and also receives a common reference time signal from an independent source.  These wireless systems are typically accurate to within $1-10$ ns \cite{Allan1980}.  One major issue with a satellite system is the inaccessibility of the satellites, which makes hardware maintenance and upgrades difficult and the satellites themselves vulnerable to attack.

Time and frequency transfer is a necessity of modern society. Accurate timekeeping is required in the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and receivers, transaction logging, and research experiments. Large scale navigation significantly improved as a result of increasingly stable clocks. Keeping time requires a periodic event that can be counted (the swing of a pendulum, the location of the sun in the sky, etc.) and an original starting time point.  The issues with clocks are how well it maintains the periodic event a constant rate, how well it resists random errors that offset the phase of said event, and how well it synchronizes with another clock dealing with similar errors.

While some errors intrinsic to a clock can be compensated, there are correctable errors that are due to bad synchronization.
All clocks are compared with the rotational rate of the Earth which is not constant, subject to axis wobbling and location relative to the sun, and has other unknown periodic fluctuations. 
Widespread adoption of good oscillators like quartz crystal oscillators, and great oscillators like cesium atomic standard.  Many research systems synchronize time through wireless transfer or electrical transfer.  Fiber optics can become a substitute for such practices, especially if one can take advantage of the existing fiber telecommunications infrastructure.
 

There are projects for implementing optical fiber time and frequency transfer systems among various European research sites.  A notable project is the R\'eseau Fibr\'e M\'etrologique \`a Vocation Europ\'eenne (REFIMEVE+) project in France. And there is a larger project called CLONETS currently in investigation stage that aims to connect many European research institutes and high-technology companies with a time and frequency fiber system.  Widespread adoption of these systems motivates the re-definition of the second to be based on an optical comb lasers rather than current microwave cesium standard.
  

Fiber optic communication systems are easy to access and can also transmit a timing signal. However, many impairments are introduced to the signal from the fiber \cite{agrawal2012fiber}.  

In a typical optical communication system, there are many data channels centered at different optical wavelengths which is a technique called wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).  Each channel has some finite bandwidth so that they do not overlap in the frequency domain.  In this thesis, we will be considering the possibility of transmitting a timing signal in the interstices of the WDM channels.  We will examine the limits that fiber impairments impose on this timing signal in a long-haul system.  Signal impairments include amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise from amplifiers, dispersion, and the Kerr nonlinearity, scattering nonlinearities, Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scattering, can also impair the signal \cite{agrawal2012fiber}\cite{agrawal1995nonlinear}.  Preliminary work indicates that this timing signal can be transmitted with both a narrow bandwidth ($< 100$ MHz) and low power ($<10$ $\mu W$) when compared to a data channel.  The bandwidth of a data channel in a long-haul system is typically $10-100$ GHz, while a typical power in a terrestrial long-haul system is $0$ dBm or $1$ mW at the transmitter and less than $-10$ dBm or $0.1$ mW prior to an amplifier as the signal attenuates.  In this case, the most important impairment that the timing channel suffers is due to cross-phase modulation between the timing channel and the neighboring data channels.  In this thesis, we will quantify the impact of cross-phase modulation on the timing channel and determine the limits that it imposes.


The individual data channels are modulated to transmit information.  Modulation formats are on-off keying (OOK), binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), and differential phase shift keying (DPSK) \cite{agrawal2012fiber}.  An OOK signal is the simplest example, a binary $0$ is represented as the absence of power and a binary $1$ is some non-zero power above a threshold to distinguish a signal from noise.  There cannot be a sharp transition from a $0$ to a $1$ and vice versa, because a communication channel can only occupy a limited bandwidth.  In practice, each bit occupies a window of time where its value is held for a short time.  The signal can start building up to a $1$ in its preceding bit window and decay back to a $0$ in its following bit window.  The bits overlap into their neighboring windows and the amount of overlap is characterized by a roll-off parameter.  This overlap is known as intersymbol interference \cite{proakis2001digital}.

The timing signal will have periodic zero crossings.  However, nonlinearities from the fiber may alter the timing of the zero crossings.  This phase change causes the timing signal to appear as if it were different frequencies.  We must find the distribution of the amplitude of the data channel in order to calculate its variance and its impact on the phase change of the timing signal.  The distribution of the amplitude of the channel is mainly influenced by dispersion.  We calculate the effect of dispersion on an OOK signal after the signal has propagated a distance long enough for dispersion to completely spread it out.  The details of this computation are covered in the following sections.  Then an analytic result is derived and compared to the numerical results.


Chapter 2 introduces methods for measuring frequency stability of oscillators. We present the reasoning behind formulating different time stability measures, and the failures of usual statistical measures (mean, variance, etc.). Then we reveal the relations between each of the methods.

Chapter 3 covers a background of the impairments a signal experiences in an optical fiber.  The impairments will affect both a data channel and the timing channel. Here the limits of the impairments will be investigated which inform power and frequency requirements on the timing channel.

Chapter 4 contains the results of computational simulations. We derive the phase noise of the timing channel due to interactions with the data channel. Then we can perform time stability analysis on the phase noise to determine the amount of frequency fluctuation on the timing signal.

Chapter 5 concludes the thesis.

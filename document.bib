Their characteristics as well as their availability, principal uses and impact are specified. The basic concepts involved in atomic frequency standards and the terminology commonly used in this field are summarized. The role of quartz crystal oscillators which are slaved to active and passive atomic frequency standards is emphasized. The traditional atomic frequency standards are reviewed, i.e. the hydrogen maser, the caesium beam tube and the passive rubidium cell frequency standards.}

@article{LohWhite,
	abstract = {The spectral purity of every oscillator system is lim- ited by phase noise. In this work, we extend the techniques previ- ously used to analyze phase noise in lasers to develop an intuitive, yet powerful description of phase noise in an electromagnetic os- cillator for the case when the oscillating field is sinusoidal and per- turbed by white noise. The developed theory is general and unifies the understanding of phase noise in both electrical and optical os- cillators. Our approach is based on partitioning the noise among the modes of the oscillator, which is analogous to the approach used to analyze phase noise in laser cavities, but has not been previ- ously considered for electrical oscillators.We show that oscillator phase noise depends only on the oscillating power, injected noise, and round-trip delay. This result provides a theoretical founda- tion to and expands upon the predictions provided by Leeson's well-known empirical oscillator phase-noisemodel. To validate the developed theory, we compare the predicted phase noise to the ex- perimentally measured phase noise of both a simple electrical os- cillator and a hybrid opto-electronic oscillator and show excellent agreement across a wide range of operation.},

Although fundamentally different, both noise sources share in common an underlying principle of analyzing noise in the basis of the oscillator. These similarities allow for an integrated description of noise using a common set of equations. With knowledge of the oscillation power, roundtrip delay, and spectrum of injected noise, the phase noise of an oscillator can be determined to high accuracy. We compare our theory to phase-noise measurements of several RF oscillators with these three parameters independently varied. In addition, we also test the validity of our theory against a hybrid optoelectronic oscillator operating under entirely different principles. Excellent agreement is found in all cases.},

	abstract = {Structure functions are apparently unfamiliar to most engineers and the unifying role they play in oscillator instability theory has largely gone unrecognized. This paper introduces and places into perspective the role which Kolmogorov structure functions have in theory. It is demonstrated that the rms fractional frequency deviation (phase accumulation) introduced by Cutler and Searle is related to the first phase structure function; the two-sample Allan variance is related to the second phase structure function. In addition, it is shown how the two-sample Allan variance is related to the rms fractional frequency deviation under suitable conditions. The L-sample Allan variance is also identified in terms of the first phase structure function; it is shown to be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the rms fractional frequency deviation squared if the latter existL The utility of higher order structure functions of frequency and phase in the theory of instability is also demonstrated; in particular, how the frequency drift and "flicker"-type noise convergence problems can be overcome.},

While this tendency is in line with theoretical reasoning, we seem to be the first to report on quantitative aspects.

These advantages apply to auto- and cross-structure functions alike when compared to auto- and cross-correlation functions, respectively. Some comments are added on the possibility of designing digital "structurators" similar to existing digital correlators, either as software products using the FFT and recursive algorithms, or as hardware products in the form of fast special purpose paralled processors.},

	abstract = {A precise fiber-based time and frequency dissemination scheme for multiple users with a tree-like branching topology is proposed. Through this scheme, ultra-stable signals can be easily accessed online anywhere along the fiber without affecting other sites. The scheme is tested through an experiment, in which a modulated frequency signal and a synchronized time signal are transferred to multiple remote sites over a delay-stabilized fiber optic links that are over 50 km long. Results show that the relative stabilities are 5E-14@1s and 2E-17@10000s. Meanwhile, compared with each site, time synchronization precision is less than 80 ps. These results can pave the way to practical applications in joint time and frequency dissemination network systems.},

	abstract = {In the paper we analyze the fundamental accuracy limits of the time/frequency transfer in fiber-optic transmission systems based on intensity modulation and direct detection (IM-DD) of the light signal. The unidirectional and bidirectional time/frequency transfer schemes are considered, and their main limitations are pointed out. In particular, the impact of the fiber backscattering and the temperature dependence of the chromatic dispersion are examined in the context of bidirectional transfer. Finally, experimental results are presented and related to the preceding considerations. The experiments performed with a 60 km long fiber demonstrate single-picosecond accuracy of the time transfer. Our measurements suggest that it should be possible to obtain better accuracy of time/frequency transfer than that reported in the literature for systems based on the},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optics is essentially the study of the interaction of strong laser light with matter. It lies at the basis of the field of photonics, the use of light fields to control other light fields and to perform logical operations. Some of the topics of this book include the fundamentals and applications of optical systems based on the nonlinear interaction of light with matter. Topics to be treated include: mechanisms of optical nonlinearity, second-harmonic and sum- and difference-frequency generation, photonics and optical logic, optical self-action effects including self-focusing and optical soliton formation, optical phase conjugation, stimulated Brillouin and stimulated Raman scattering, and selection criteria of nonlinear optical materials. Covers all the latest topics and technology in this ever-evolving area of study that forms the backbone of the major applications of optical technology Offers first-rate instructive style making it ideal for self-study Emphasizes the fundamentals of non-linear optics rather than focus on particular applications that are constantly changing},

Previously, we showed that Rayleigh-scattering-induced noise in optical fibers coupled with amplitude-to-phase noise conversion in photodetectors and amplifiers leads to fiber-length-dependent noise in OEOs. In this work, we report on two methods for the suppression of this fiber-length-dependent noise: altering the amplitude-dependent phase delay of the OEO loops and suppressing the Rayleigh-scattering-induced noise in optical fibers. We report a 20 dB reduction in the flicker phase noise of a 6 km OEO via these suppression techniques.},

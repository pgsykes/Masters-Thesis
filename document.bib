@article{Lindsey1976,
	abstract = {Structure functions are apparently unfamiliar to most engineers and the unifying role they play in oscillator instability theory has largely gone unrecognized. This paper introduces and places into perspective the role which Kolmogorov structure functions have in theory. It is demonstrated that the rms fractional frequency deviation (phase accumulation) introduced by Cutler and Searle is related to the first phase structure function; the two-sample Allan variance is related to the second phase structure function. In addition, it is shown how the two-sample Allan variance is related to the rms fractional frequency deviation under suitable conditions. The L-sample Allan variance is also identified in terms of the first phase structure function; it is shown to be an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the rms fractional frequency deviation squared if the latter existL The utility of higher order structure functions of frequency and phase in the theory of instability is also demonstrated; in particular, how the frequency drift and "flicker"-type noise convergence problems can be overcome.},

@article{Schulz-DuBois1981,

While this tendency is in line with theoretical reasoning, we seem to be the first to report on quantitative aspects. Taking wall pressure data from a transsonic wind tunnel, our structure functions are obtained with one to two orders less of data points than correlation functions of comparable information content. These advantages apply to auto- and cross-structure functions alike when compared to auto- and cross-correlation functions, respectively. Some comments are added on the possibility of designing digital "structurators" similar to existing digital correlators, either as software products using the FFT and recursive algorithms, or as hardware products in the form of fast special purpose paralled processors.},

Through this scheme, ultra-stable signals can be easily accessed online anywhere along the fiber without affecting other sites. The scheme is tested through an experiment, in which a modulated frequency signal and a synchronized time signal are transferred to multiple remote sites over a delay-stabilized fiber optic links that are over 50 km long. Results show that the relative stabilities are 5E-14@1s and 2E-17@10000s. Meanwhile, compared with each site, time synchronization precision is less than 80 ps. These results can pave the way to practical applications in joint time and frequency dissemination network systems.},

The unidirectional and bidirectional time/frequency transfer schemes are considered, and their main limitations are pointed out. In particular, the impact of the fiber backscattering and the temperature dependence of the chromatic dispersion are examined in the context of bidirectional transfer. Finally, experimental results are presented and related to the preceding considerations. The experiments performed with a 60 km long fiber demonstrate single-picosecond accuracy of the time transfer. Our measurements suggest that it should be possible to obtain better accuracy of time/frequency transfer than that reported in the literature for systems based on the},

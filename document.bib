abstract = {Binary sequences of length n = 2m- 1 whose autocorrelation 
function is either 1 or -1/n have been known for a long time, and are 
called pseudo-random (or PN) sequences, or maximal-length shift-register 
sequences. Two-dimensional arrays of area n = 2lm- 1 with the same 
property have rcently been found by several authors. This paper gives a 
simple description of such sequences and arrays and their many nice 
properties.},
